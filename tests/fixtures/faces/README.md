Put real face images here for integration-like tests.

Expected files (you can change names in the test if you want):
- alice.jpg (or .png)
- bob.jpg (or .png)

Guidelines:
- Use clear, front-facing photos.
- Prefer one face per image.
- Images can be color; tests convert to grayscale internally.

These files are intentionally not committed by the assistant (binary data). Add your own photos locally.
